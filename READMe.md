### Lab assignment: Segmentation
## Week 1( 02/02/2026)

## Lab Overview

## Learning Goals

## Part A - Simulated Image

1. Task A1 - Create Simulated Scenario

2. Task A2 - Capture image from RoboDK Simulated Camera

3. Task A3 - Thresholding

4. Task A4 - Cleaning with Morphology

5. Task A5 – Contours, Area, and Centroid

## Discussion:

Q1: Which thresholding method gave the most stable results across your images?
Q2: Did filtering and morphology help improve segmentation?
Q3: What kinds of errors still remain (false positives, missed objects, shape distortions)?
Q4: How would you change the lighting or camera setup in the real lab to make segmentation easier?
Discuss your findings (how easy it was, how long did it take, how fast it processes the images, etc.) about the process.
